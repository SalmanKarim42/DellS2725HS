      troubleshooting steps:
    </p>

    <h2>Solution 1: Restart the DELL_S2725HS service</h2>
    <p>
      If you previously enabled
      <a href="https://tinypilotkvm.com/faq/ssh-credentials">SSH</a> on your
      DELL_S2725HS, you can check whether the DELL_S2725HS service is running by
      logging in via SSH and running the following command:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sudo service DellS2725HS status</code></pre>

    <p>
      If the service is not listed as <code>Active: active (running)</code>,
      restart the DELL_S2725HS service with the following command:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sudo service DellS2725HS restart</code></pre>

    <p>After the command completes, reload this page.</p>

    <h2>Solution 2: Restart your DELL_S2725HS</h2>
    <p>
      If you previously enabled SSH on your DELL_S2725HS, log in via SSH and try
      restarting your DELL_S2725HS by running the following command:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sudo reboot</code></pre>

    <p>
      If you don't have SSH access, wait two minutes before powering off your
      DELL_S2725HS. Then, power on your DELL_S2725HS, and wait a minute before
      reloading this page.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution 3: Reset your DELL_S2725HS to factory settings</h2>
    <p>
      If you have just updated your DELL_S2725HS, or if your DELL_S2725HS recently
      experienced sudden power loss, your DELL_S2725HS may have a corrupted
      filesystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <a href="https://tinypilotkvm.com/faq/factory-reset">factory reset</a>
      will restore your DELL_S2725HS back to a working state.
